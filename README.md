# cointelegraph-crawler

## Goal
This project uses Selenium to crawl the website https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin and collect all the articles urls. From here this will write all the URLs to a text file. 

Why do this?

Having the urls in a text file, allows us to then create another script to scrape content from every article for sentiment analysis.
